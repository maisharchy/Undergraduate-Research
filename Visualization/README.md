# Interactive Dendrogram and Clustering Visualizations Notebook

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to create interactive dendrograms and other clustering visualizations using Plotly. The notebook covers various clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering, and visualizes the results using dendrograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and sunburst charts.

## Features

- **Interactive Dendrograms:** Create interactive dendrograms using Plotly with features like zooming, panning, tooltips, and color coding.
- **Dropdown Menus for Branch Selection:** Dynamically update the dendrogram based on the selected branch through dropdown menus.
- **Scatter Plots and Heatmaps:** Visualize cluster assignments using scatter plots and heatmaps.
- **Sunburst Chart for Hierarchical Clustering:** Represent hierarchical cluster relationships in an intuitive sunburst chart.
- **Customization:** Offers a variety of customizations such as tooltip information, cluster coloring, and subplot arrangements.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this notebook:

- `plotly`
- `scipy`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install plotly scipy numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook plotly-dendrogram.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to generate and interact with the dendrogram and other visualizations.

## Visualizations Included

- **Dendrogram:** Hierarchical clustering visualization with interactive features.
- **Scatter Plot:** Visualization of clustered data points in a 2D space.
- **Heatmap:** 2D histogram representation of clustered data points.
- **Sunburst Chart:** Displays the hierarchical structure of clusters in a sunburst chart.

## Data

The notebook uses synthetic data generated by the `make_blobs` function from `sklearn.datasets`. You can replace the synthetic data with your own dataset if desired.

## Customization

- **Cluster Depth:** Adjust the number of clusters visualized by changing the `n_clusters` parameter.
- **Tooltip Information:** Customize the information displayed on hover in the dendrogram by modifying the tooltip code.
- **Color Coding:** Modify the color scheme for different clusters as per your preference.

## Example Output

This notebook produces a variety of interactive visualizations that you can view directly in your browser. These include dendrograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and sunburst charts.

# Visualization of CodeConceptNet

## Overview

This part of the project focuses on Visualization for Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and a Flask application for interaction with the clustered data.

## Features

- **Dynamic Clustering**: Uses agglomerative clustering to organize data into hierarchical clusters.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Allows users to explore the hierarchical structure of clusters.
- **Flask Application**: A web interface for viewing and interacting with the clustered data.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maisharchy/Undergraduate-Research.git
   cd Undergraduate-Research/Visualization
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install necessary Python packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Flask App**:
   Start the Flask server by executing the main script.
   ```bash
   python app1.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

2. **Visualizing Clusters**:
   The linkage matrix from the model is used to display hierarchical clustering. The processed data points and vocabulary are also utilized for analysis and visualization.

## Files

- **`app1.py`**: Main Flask application script.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.
- **`linkage_matrix_from_model.pkl`**: Contains the linkage matrix used for hierarchical clustering.
- **`processed-point.npy`**: Processed data points for clustering.
- **`processed-vocab.npy`**: Processed vocabulary data for clustering.
- **`model-500-agglomerative-clustering.pkl`**: The trained agglomerative clustering model.
